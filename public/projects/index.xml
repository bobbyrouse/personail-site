      <description>Foodle is the flagship product of the company I cofounded under the same name.
We created Foodle as the ideal on-the-go food storage solution. This novel design is based on a drybag, which is used for watersports, and creates an air and watertight seal. This is ideal for commuters, professionals, or anyone who carries food with them throughout the day. And since it is a single component, that means no more searching for that matching lid!</description>
